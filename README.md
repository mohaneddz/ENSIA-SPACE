# ENSIA Space

**A Fun and Playful Exploration of Web Development**

## Introduction
Welcome to **ENSIA Space**, a project created in just 5 days during the winter break, with no prior knowledge of CSS, HTML, or JavaScript. This was an optional homework assignment for university, designed primarily for fun and creativity. Please note that this project is filled with numerous memes and cultural references, and it is not intended to be taken seriously.

## About the Project
